This repository is a product of my project as part of the final project in the 10th grade. It was created for reasons of improving the security system on Linux OS, since hacker attacks on computers and companies in general have become more frequent in our time.
Sometimes there is a need to open some ports to connect the server or other computers, hence there is a high probability of hacking. This is where my product comes to the rescue, which disconnects from you any ip address that is not on the white list.
The first autotcpkill script scans all active connections and whitelists them, after which it automatically runs the second connection_check script, which periodically checks active connections, and if there is no new connection in the whitelist, it automatically disconnects this ip address from you.
